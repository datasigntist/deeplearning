        "This notebook illustrates the concept of Genetic Computing through an example (8 Queens) based approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. Ref : [Genetic Computing](https://in.mathworks.com/help/gads/what-is-the-genetic-algorithm.html)\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of the 8 Queens is to place the 8 Queens on chessboard such that none of the Queens intersect their pathways. This can also be solved using recursion based methodology and backtracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of Genetic Computing the following are the key elements\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Defining a solution space by generating an initial population \n",
        "*   The solution space consists of potential configurations\n",
        "*   Defining a fitness function to evaluate the solutions in the solution space\n",
        "*   Here the 8 Queens can be represented by a vector (representing columns in a chessboard) which denotes the row positions of the placement of queens. The following sequence 8,3,2,1,4,5,6,7 reflects the positions where the queen has been placed in each of the columns of the chessboard. For e.g the 1st queen is placed in the 8th row of the 1st column in the chessboard, the 2nd queen is placed in the 3rd row of the 2nd column in the chessboard\n",
        "*   The sequence 8,3,2,1,4,5,6,7  is one of the several possible configurations in the solutions space. Each sequence has a corresponding fitness score. In this particular context the number of non attacking pairs which is 28. Ref : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38886580/maximum-number-of-non-attacking-pairs-of-queens-in-8-queens\n",
        "*   Once the initial population and fitness score is done, new configurations are created in the solution space through crossover and mutation.\n",
        "*  The following figure shows how the crossover and mutation works.

        "In this particular scenario an initial population of 100 configurations are created in random and their fitness value is calculated. The top 2 parents are selected and there are different variations one can have in the algorithm. In this context the parent with the top fitness score is selected as one of the parents, the other parent is selected in random.  Once the 2 parents are selected a crossover and mutation is applied to generate new children. There could be different variations in the approach. The crossover is applied at a specific juncture of the sequence, currently its defined as 4 while the mutation is applied in random."
